# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, in unsupervised learning, models themselves find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data.

## How Unsupervised Learning Works?

In unsupervised learning, models are trained using an unlabeled dataset. Once the training process is completed, the model applies suitable algorithms such as k-means clustering, Decision tree, etc., to find the underlying structure of the dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format.

## Applications of Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning can be used for various real-world applications such as exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasksâ€”clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction:

1. **Clustering**: Clustering is a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information.
2. **Association**: Association rules allow you to establish associations amongst data objects inside large databases. This unsupervised technique is about discovering interesting relationships between variables in large databases.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the complexity of data computation so that it can be performed more quickly.

Some popular examples of unsupervised machine learning algorithms are K-means for clustering problems, and Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems.
